# toolbox

Toolbox is a golang base common library.

util is short for "utility", typically referring to general-purpose tool functions and methods that are independent of specific business logic.

The diference between utils and kits is that the utils is a collection of functions, without any dependencies.

• Characteristics:
    • Lightweight, focused on specific small functions or independent functional points
    • No clear domain restrictions, usually consisting of scattered utility functions
    • Commonly used to support higher-level business logic

• Usage Scenarios:
    • Handling common tasks such as string operations, date formatting, data conversion, etc.
    • Independent of specific business logic or context

• Examples:
    • Node.js util module: provides general utility functions like util.promisify, util.format
    • lodash utility library: includes many common utility functions like deep copy, array deduplication, etc.
